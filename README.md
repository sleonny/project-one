Generated Daily Quotes!

A fully functional site integrating two API's for the purpose of retrieving a randomly inspirational quote and giving the user the opportunity to find a word that they do not understand from that quote to better understand the complete meaning.

The site starts with a header "Generated Daily Quotes"! An API site "Quote Garden" creates a Randomly Generated Daily Quote which appears in a card. 
add We incorporated a API Dictinary, that searches for a word in the dictinary, that if a user does not understand, they can enter the word and learn the meaning of this word, then store that word and meaning in the local storage. 
 
The technologies we used were HTML, Javascript and Materialize as CSS framework for our site and publish it in github.# project-one
